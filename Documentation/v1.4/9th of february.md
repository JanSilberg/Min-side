# 9th of February

I have added 5 pages which I had from the old design.
- Home, Portfolio, CV, Contact & links.

So far for design v2.0 I will use the same page names, but nothing from the design will be the same.

I will follow the design development template from the Repository main README file.

I have uploaded pictures from the old design as documentation.

For the new design v2.0 I have created the pages in Figma, and are working on the Home-page.

New design will start at v2.0 since the old design ended at v1.3 and it's a major redesign.
